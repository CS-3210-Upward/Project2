## Project 2: Lexical and Syntax Analysis

This is a team project. Please read the project description below carefully and submit your code here when you finish.

### Part 1: Programming

Write a program in a language of your choice that takes in a Python program as input and performs the following tasks:

1. Check to ensure correct indentation in the input program. If incorrect, fix it.
2. Verify the syntactic correctness of all function headers. If incorrect, fix them.
3. Count the occurrences of the keyword "print" in the input program.
4. Output to a text file the original input program, the updated input program, and the count of occurrences of the keyword "print."
